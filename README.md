# Smartess

## CI information

In this project, we use a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to automate the development and testing of our application. The main tools involved are GitHub Actions for automation, Docker for containerization, Jest for testing, and ESLint for checking code quality. This combination of tools ensures that code is consistently tested and validated as soon as changes are made. This setup catches issues early in the development process, reducing the cost and effort required to fix them if they were discovered later in the development lifecycle.


## Project Summary 
Smartess is an all-in-one smart home system designed for condominium and residential communities. It serves both tenants and property owners, with tenants benefiting from a fully integrated smart home experience in their unit, while owners manage everything through a centralized application. This project involves building a web platform that property owners can use to monitor units and buildings in real-time. Data is collected through smart appliances and equipment on the property, processed, and presented to owners through the application, providing valuable insights and statistics. The application also acts as a communication tool for property owners, enabling announcements and automated emails. Owners can receive maintenance requests from tenants directly through the platform. The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly application that simplifies smart home management for property owners.

## Developer getting started guide
What would a new developer need to do to get the system up and running?

Currently the hub and web system are being developped separately as for scalability benefits. Later in the project, some commands will be set up to launch both systems at the same time.

For Hub: Refer to []()
For Web: Refer to [Web developper's guide](https://github.com/leobrod44/Smartess/tree/main/smartessweb#readme)
