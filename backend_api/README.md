### NOTE 

- This README file will be updated once again when the backend API will be contained.
- There are 3 section. The first section will explain how to setup your environment. The second section will tell you about how to run the API. The third will explain how to organize and write code.

### One-time Instructions:

There is a security aspect which requires setting a .env file. This needs to be done only once initially. For running instructions just head over to the next section below.

1. Locate the backend_api folder:

2. Install create a .env file like the following:
   
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/695a3320-51a1-4c83-8834-fc79ae283e75)

3. Paste the following code:

  ```bash
    PORT=3000
    SUPABASE_URL="URL"
    SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="KEY"
  ```

4. DM Abdullah. He will provide you with the URL and key.

5. Replace the URL and KEY accordingly. 

### Running Instructions:

These instructions will be updated once contained.

1. In your code editor terminal go to the correct folder/directory (it is "backend_api"). For reference, here is how mine looks:

   ```bash
     PS C:\Users\Abdullah\Desktop\Fall2024\SOEN490\Capstone\Smartess\backend_api> 
   ```

2. Type the following command and press enter:

   ```bash
     npm install
   ```

3. Now to start the server type the following and press enter:

    ```bash
     npm start
   ```
4. Test 1: Open your broswer and type :

   ```bash
     http://localhost:3001/test1
   ```

   You should see the following result:

5. Test 2: Open your broswer and type :

   ```bash
     http://localhost:3001/test2/test2
   ```

   You should see the following result:
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/091ed530-08cb-4559-8815-15b308ecc48b)
